Task 1 Divide integers as strings (C++)

Given positive integers a and b as strings, evaluate a / b and return the quotient and the remainder as strings in the form [quotient, remainder] (vector<string> {quotient, remainder} in C++).

a and b can be very large (at the order of 10^150 to 10^200)
As usual, your result should not have leading 0s
require is disabled in JavaScript. Do it yourself ;-)

Task 2 Longest Common Subsequence (Performance version)

from Wikipedia:
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences.
It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

Task
Write a function lcs that accepts two strings and returns their longest common subsequence as a string. Performance matters.

Examples
lcs( "abcdef", "abc" ) => "abc"
lcs( "abcdef", "acf" ) => "acf"
lcs( "132535365", "123456789" ) => "12356"
lcs( "abcdefghijklmnopq", "apcdefghijklmnobq" ) => "acdefghijklmnoq"
lcs "abcdef" "abc" -> "abc"
lcs "abcdef" "acf" -> "acf"
lcs "132535365" "123456789" -> "12356"
lcs "abcdefghijklmnopq" "apcdefghijklmnobq" -> "acdefghijklmnoq"
Testing
This is a performance version of xDranik's kata of the same name.
This kata, however, has much more full and heavy testing. Intermediate random tests have string arguments of 20 characters; hard random tests 40 characters; extreme 60 characters (characters are chosen out of 36 different ones).

Notes
The subsequences of "abc" are "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc".
"" is a valid subsequence in this kata, and a possible return value.
All inputs will be valid.
Two strings may have more than one longest common subsequence. When this occurs, return any of them.

lcs( string0, string1 ) === lcs( string1, string0 )
lcs xs ys == lcs ys xs

Task 3 Path Finder #2: shortest path (C++)

You are at position [0, 0] in maze NxN and you can only move in one of the four cardinal directions (i.e. North, East, South, West). Return the minimal number of steps to exit position [N-1, N-1] if it is possible to reach the exit from the starting position. Otherwise, return false in JavaScript/Python and -1 in C++/C#/Java.

Empty positions are marked .. Walls are marked W. Start and exit positions are guaranteed to be empty in all test cases.

Task 4 Rainfall (C++)

data and data1 are two strings with rainfall records of a few cities for months from January to December. The records of towns are separated by \n. The name of each town is followed by :.

data and towns can be seen in "Your Test Cases:".

Task:
function: mean(town, strng) should return the average of rainfall for the city town and the strng data or data1 (In R and Julia this function is called avg).
function: variance(town, strng) should return the variance of rainfall for the city town and the strng data or data1.
Examples:
mean("London", data), 51.19(9999999999996) 
variance("London", data), 57.42(833333333374)
Notes:
if functions mean or variance have as parameter town a city which has no records return -1 or -1.0 (depending on the language)
Don't truncate or round: the tests will pass if abs(your_result - test_result) <= 1e-2 or abs((your_result - test_result) / test_result) <= 1e-6 depending on the language.
Shell tests only variance
